DiReCT (Disaster Record Capture Tool) is using by trained professionals to capture and record observational data during disasters and emergencies and can produce records in standard formats readable by search, analysis, simulation and visualization tools. Also, carry out data quality assurance and real-time quality control to improve the completeness and consistency of data on disasters and emergencies.
