# DiReCT
Today, disaster historical records are typically written in natural language text together with tables, graphs, etc. In their current form, disaster records have two shortcomings. Data and information may be inconsistent and incomplete, and such defects take time and effort to uncover.

Mobile Disaster Record Capture Tool (DiReCT) is used by trained professionals to capture and record observational data during disasters and emergencies. Disaster records produced with the help of the system can be read and processed by search, analysis, simulation and visualization tools for purposes such as developing better response strategies, providing decision support during emergencies, post-disaster analysis, and so on.
